            <p style={{ fontWeight: 800, padding: 0 }}>What are cake pops?</p>
            <p style={{ padding: 0 }}>Cake pops are 3-4 bites of deliciously moist cake coated in only the finest chocolate and scrumptious toppings.
                The average cake pop is the size of a golf ball, though the character and holiday pops are usually larger.</p>
            <p style={{ fontWeight: 800 }}> How long do they last?</p>
            <p style={{ padding: 0 }}> Our cake pops last 3 days at room temperature. They can be refrigerated for a week and they can be frozen for up to 3 weeks!
                Just let them defrost until they reach room temperature and enjoy!</p>
            <p style={{ fontWeight: 800 }}> How are the cake pops packaged?</p>
            <p style={{ padding: 0 }}> Each cake pop is also individually wrapped for maximum freshness.
                Pops must be stored in a dry & cool place, just like chocolate.</p>
            <p style={{ fontWeight: 800 }}>Do your cake pops contain nuts or nut byproducts? Are they gluten-free?</p>
            <p style={{ padding: 0 }}> Unfortunately, our cake pops are not produced in a nut-free facility, so we cannot guarantee cross contamination with nut byproducts.
                In the future we hope to provide gluten-free and nut-free cake pops to accomodate certain dietary needs.</p>
            <p style={{ fontWeight: 800 }}>When should I place my order?</p>
            <p style={{ padding: 0 }}>
                For orders of 1-6 dozen, we kindly ask that you submit and confirm your order
                5 business days prior to delivery date.
                For orders of 6 dozen+ we require 7 business days notice.
                Rush orders will incur a 15% surcharge.</p>
            <p style={{ fontWeight: 800 }}>How many cake pops should I order for
                my event?</p>
            <p style={{ padding: 0 }}>We usually recommend 1-2 cake pops per person for any event. Many of our regular clients have mentioned that the cake pops are always a hit and tend to order 2 per person.
                What can we say... 1 cake pop is never enough!</p>
            <p style={{ fontWeight: 800 }}>Do I get a discount for large orders?</p>
            <p style={{ padding: 0 }}>Yes! For every order of 11 dozen cake pops, you will receive one free dozen!</p>

            <p style={{ fontWeight: 800 }}>Where do I pick up my cake pops? Can they be shipped or delivered?</p>

                During the warmer months of May through September, we include thermo-technology insulation with ice packs.
